	<h1> Collin's Updates </h1>
	<h3> Week 3 and before 2/11/18 </h3>
	
	<p>To start off the journey I met with my team, the mobile development team, and the other teams that we'll be working with on this project.
		We then set up a communication line between us through a program called slack where we can exchange information with eachother.
		We also met our client Mike Flamm where we hashed out the initial requirement and what he really is looking for in this project.
		We exchanged information to keep in contact with him and set things up through Slack, Google Hangouts and Github</p>
	<p>We met up as a team the following Monday after getting our requirement and decided that we were going to be using an android emulator to code our project on.
		Nick helped Ben, Malik and I set it up on our computers. On the android emulator we agreed to use React Native to code on
		and the client agreed to this.</p>
	<p>Last Wednesday we had our most previous group meeting where Ben and I worked on seperate designs for the mobile application. We decided to
		use Ben's design, but I thought of some improvments that we could do to it such as ease of access or just move some stuff around.
		We then had our next meeting with Mike over google hangouts. We showed him our current design and suggestions that we could and compared 
		it to his design. He critiqued our a bit, but overall he really liked it. We then decided to set the time to meet him was 7pm on Wednesdays.
		We also set our goal for the week was to finalize the design and start working on the skelaton for the app.</p>
	<p>Lastly I started working within React Native to understand how it works. I also started to learn the language that is being coded in it
		to help myself when it comes to when we start to code the actual assignment.</p>
