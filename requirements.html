<h3> Project Requirements and Specifications </h3>

<ol>
	<li> Work with other teams on the database and desktop application to develop the best tools for Delta V Innovations with the goal in mind for future implementation. Our goal will be to have a complete project encompassing these requirements for presentation in Marksbury Theater by the end of the Spring 2018 Semester. </li>
	<li> Work with the desktop team to define functions for operation between the mobile app and the desktop application with the goal of making it avaliable for future implementations:</li>
		<ol type='a'>
			<li> Save New Job data created by user to server </li>
			<li> Search vehicle database (already owned by company) </li>
			<li>Search reference material database (data has been acquired by company)</li>
		</ol>
	<li>The app produced must be cross platform and able to work on a variety of devices including iPhones, iPads, Android phones, and Android Tablets.</li>
	<li>Develop a tab/menu function that will include the ability to create a new job, access reference materials, and access the vehicle database. </li>
	<ol type = 'a'>
		<li> Allow for users to access the reference materials without being logged in for ease of access </li>
	</ol>
	<li> In the new job options have a tab for adding new vehicle, crash location, scene data, photos, and notes.</li>
	<li> Allow for the collection of GPS coordinates for geo-referencing. </li>
	<li> Back up data to the server on a set interval to ensure that signifigant amounts of data are not lost in the event of an app crash or lost phone. Allow for the user to manually back up data within the app as well and change the setting for how often they want backups to occur.</li>
	<li> Automatically fill out fields on the app by calculating common formulas based on user information inputs. </li>
	<li> Use APIs for transmitting weather information and vehicle information to the database </li>
	<li> Stretch Goal: Make a QR reader using external resources to read information off of the barcode/QR code on inside of vehicle's door and automatically fill into the form. Then send the information to the database. </li>
</ol>
